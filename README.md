## Agile

What is agile?
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It is a mindset and a set of principles that guide the development process and enable teams to respond to change and deliver value in a more efficient and adaptive manner.

The Agile methodology was introduced as an alternative to traditional waterfall project management methods, which follow a linear, sequential process. In contrast, Agile embraces change and recognizes that requirements and priorities may evolve throughout a project's lifecycle.

Key characteristics and principles of agile:

- Iterative Development: Agile projects are divided into small iterations or time-boxed iterations called sprints. Each iteration involves the completion of a specific set of tasks, and feedback is gathered from stakeholders at the end of each iteration.

- Collaboration and Communication: Agile emphasizes frequent collaboration and open communication among team members, stakeholders, and customers. Regular meetings, such as daily stand-ups, allow teams to share progress, discuss challenges, and make decisions collectively.

- Customer-Centric Approach: Agile prioritizes customer satisfaction by involving them in the development process. Continuous feedback and involvement help ensure that the product meets their needs and expectations.

- Adaptive Planning: Agile recognizes that requirements and priorities can change over time. Rather than attempting to plan every detail upfront, Agile projects focus on creating a flexible and adaptable plan that can be adjusted based on feedback and changing circumstances.

- Empowered and Self-Organizing Teams: Agile teams are typically cross-functional and self-organizing. They have the authority and responsibility to make decisions and take ownership of their work, which fosters a sense of accountability and promotes creativity and innovation.

- Continuous Improvement: Agile promotes a culture of continuous improvement. Teams reflect on their work at the end of each iteration and identify areas for improvement. This feedback loop helps teams learn and adapt, leading to more effective processes and better outcomes.

Withing Agile there are a few Frameworks with differences between them, with each their own advantages and disadvantages.
These frameworks are picked on what works best for a team or project.
Here are 2 examples called Scrum and Kanban.

## Scrum

### What is scrum?

Scrum is a popular Agile framework for managing and organizing complex projects, particularly in software development. It provides a flexible and iterative approach to project management, emphasizing collaboration, transparency, and adaptability. Scrum is based on the principles of Agile and focuses on delivering value to the customer in incremental iterations.

Here are the key components and roles in Scrum:

Product Owner: The Product Owner represents the interests of the stakeholders and customers. They define and prioritize the product backlog, which is a list of desired features, enhancements, and fixes for the product. The Product Owner works closely with the development team to ensure that the product backlog items are clear, valuable, and aligned with the project goals.

Scrum Master: The Scrum Master is responsible for facilitating the Scrum process and ensuring that the Scrum principles and practices are followed. They act as a coach and facilitator for the Scrum team, removing any obstacles or impediments that may hinder progress. The Scrum Master also helps the team maintain focus and continuously improve their processes.

Development Team: The Development Team consists of professionals who are responsible for delivering the product increment. The team is self-organizing and cross-functional, meaning they have all the necessary skills to complete the work. They collaborate closely with the Product Owner to understand the requirements and deliver high-quality increments of the product.

Sprints: A sprint is a time-boxed iteration in Scrum, typically lasting between one to four weeks. During a sprint, the Development Team works on a set of product backlog items that they commit to delivering by the end of the sprint. The work is planned and managed through daily Scrum meetings, where team members synchronize their efforts, discuss progress, and identify any challenges.

Sprint Planning: At the beginning of each sprint, the Scrum team holds a sprint planning meeting. During this meeting, the team and the Product Owner collaborate to select the backlog items to be worked on in the upcoming sprint. They also define the specific tasks required to complete those items and estimate the effort required.

Daily Scrum: The Daily Scrum, or daily stand-up, is a short meeting held by the Development Team. It is typically time-boxed to 15 minutes and provides an opportunity for team members to share progress, discuss any obstacles or issues, and plan their work for the day.

Sprint Review: At the end of each sprint, a sprint review meeting is conducted to showcase the completed work to stakeholders and gather their feedback. This feedback is used to update and reprioritize the product backlog.

Sprint Retrospective: Following the sprint review, the Scrum team holds a sprint retrospective to reflect on the sprint and identify areas for improvement. The team discusses what went well, what didn't go well, and action items for enhancing their processes and practices.

Scrum promotes transparency, iterative development, and frequent feedback, allowing teams to adapt to changing requirements and deliver value in a more efficient and collaborative manner.

### Our scrum usage (gp)

In our groupsproject we started out by using scrum as it is an effective way to manage our team. The sprints work perfect for us because we have set standards on when and what we want to deliver at a set time.
Altough our project started out a bit rough and missing some understanding of scrum, we made continious improvement on our process and kept learning and improving on how to do better. Also the role management in the team helps us with leadership and gives each member a fair opportunity the show the best of themselves. However Scrum is not able to work fully because of a lack of a team in the individual project but i will elaborate on that further in the Kanban usage topic . 
Now in our final sprint, we will show the correct usage of scrum and the results it can have in our groupsproject. 

### Scrum boards

BE (https://github.com/orgs/Fontys-OAMK-Beter/projects/2)
FE (https://github.com/orgs/Fontys-OAMK-Beter/projects/3/views/1)

Between the front end and back end board, you can already see the enormous progress we made, how we managed to make it our own. And what extra features and functionality we added. 
Altough it was a learning curve, its was good to learn how to set it up the correct way as it will provide major benefits in the future. 

## Kanban

### What is kanban?

Kanban is an Agile framework that focuses on visualizing work, limiting work in progress (WIP), and optimizing the flow of tasks or items through a process. Originally developed by Toyota for lean manufacturing, Kanban has been widely adopted in software development and other knowledge work domains.

In Kanban, work is represented as individual items or tasks on a Kanban board, which is a visual representation of the workflow. The Kanban board typically consists of columns that represent different stages of work, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." Each item moves across the board as it progresses through the workflow.

Here are the key concepts and principles of Kanban:

Visualize Work: The primary principle of Kanban is visualizing work. The Kanban board provides a clear and shared understanding of the work in progress, allowing team members to see what tasks are currently being worked on, what tasks are waiting, and what tasks have been completed.

Limit Work in Progress (WIP): Kanban encourages setting explicit limits on the number of tasks or items that can be in progress at each stage of the workflow. This helps prevent overloading individuals or the team and promotes better focus and efficiency. Limiting WIP also highlights bottlenecks and impediments in the workflow.

Flow and Continuous Improvement: Kanban aims to optimize the flow of work through the system. By visualizing the workflow and identifying bottlenecks or delays, teams can focus on addressing those issues to improve the overall flow. Continuous improvement is a core principle, and teams are encouraged to experiment with their processes and make incremental changes to achieve better flow and efficiency.

Pull-Based System: Kanban operates on a pull-based system, where work is pulled into the system based on available capacity. As team members complete tasks, they can pull new tasks from the backlog to keep the workflow steady and maintain a smooth flow of work.

Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits: As mentioned earlier, Kanban employs WIP limits to prevent overloading and ensure a steady workflow. WIP limits help teams identify and address bottlenecks and encourage a focus on completing tasks before starting new ones.

Continuous Delivery: Kanban emphasizes delivering value continuously. Instead of working in fixed iterations, teams using Kanban strive to deliver completed work items as soon as they are ready, enabling faster feedback and value realization.

Kanban provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to different team sizes, workflows, and processes. It promotes transparency, collaboration, and a continuous improvement mindset, enabling teams to optimize their work processes and deliver value more effectively.

### Kanban usage

Altough I haven't officially used Kanban we actually unintentionally started our groupsproject with using a mix of scrum and kanban. Mainly with how we tackled our stories and the backlog.
Because of the continuous delivery this would not have worked in our groupproject but would have actually been great for my individual project. So Altough not fully utilized, I will for sure use this on my next individual project as this fits my style of working better. 

## Waterfall

### what is waterfall?

Waterfall is a traditional project management methodology that follows a linear, sequential approach to software development and project execution. In the waterfall model, each phase of the project is completed before moving on to the next phase, resembling a cascading waterfall.

Here are the typical phases in the waterfall model:

Requirements Gathering: The project requirements are gathered and documented in detail during this initial phase. This involves understanding the client's needs, defining project scope, and establishing specific goals and objectives.

System Design: In this phase, the system architecture and design are planned and documented. The requirements gathered in the previous phase are translated into a technical design, including database structure, software modules, and user interfaces.

Implementation: The development team begins coding and implementing the system based on the detailed design specifications. Each component or module is developed separately, and integration occurs in later stages.

Testing: Once the implementation phase is complete, comprehensive testing is conducted to identify and resolve any defects or issues. This phase includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

Deployment: After successful testing, the system is deployed to the production environment or handed over to the end-users. This phase involves installing the software, configuring the system, and ensuring it is ready for use.

Maintenance: Once the system is deployed, ongoing maintenance and support activities are performed, such as bug fixing, updates, and user support.

Waterfall methodology follows a strict sequential flow, where each phase is completed before proceeding to the next one. It assumes that requirements can be completely defined upfront and that changes are minimal throughout the project. The success of the project heavily relies on accurate requirements gathering and a well-defined plan.

While waterfall can provide structure and clarity in projects with stable and well-understood requirements, it has limitations. The approach can be rigid and less adaptive to changes or evolving requirements. Issues or changes identified in later stages may require significant rework or delay project completion.

Due to its limitations, many organizations have shifted towards Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, which prioritize flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development to address the challenges faced by the waterfall model.

### Usage Waterfall

I have not used Waterfall as I do not see it working in my project. Waterfall assumes the project and requirements are a fixed thing, but because of my lack of knowledge and the nature of coding in general that is extremely difficult to keep up, some small changes always have to be made. Also Waterfall only gives feedback at the end of the development cycle which is bad for groupproject and individual because we need to take our stakeholders through the process of how we work. 

# Learning Outcome 4: CI/CD
*You **design and implement** a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.*

Clarification:

**Design and implement**: You design a release process and implement a continuous integration and deployment solution (using e.g. Gitlab CI and Docker).

## Continuous Integration

For The CI part I have set up a project on Github(link) 
In the project is a pipeline where if the project is build without errors and gets pushed to main it will automatically build on docker and be availble for a container.

## Continuous Deployment

For the CD part setup is in my main project a pipeline that auto pushes the project to main if the tests are succeeded, after they succeeded it checks and pushes the project to azure on where it is hosted online.

# Learning Outcome 5: Cultural Differences and Ethics
*You **recognize** and **take into account** cultural differences when working with multi-site teams and are aware of ethical aspects in software development.*

Clarification:

**Recognize**:  Recognition is based on theoretically substantiated awareness of cultural differences and ethical aspects in software engineering.

**Take into account**: Adapt your communication, working, and behaviour styles to work with other developers from different cultures; 
Address one of the standard Programming Ethical Guidelines (e.g., ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct) in your work.  

## Research paper

## group management
*You have studied a subset of the materials provided below.* (https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/13025/pages/group-management-can-you-work-with-people-from-other-cultures?module_item_id=916360)
*You have applied the theory in a practical situation (preferably in your group but if this is not applicable then in your daily life).*

- Can you give examples for cultural differences that you have experienced in your study or life?

The common known work culture thing for Dutch people is the Dutch directness, not beating around the bush and getting straight to the point.
This can be too direct for people, altough other people prefer it this way. 

- What is your culture?

As I am half indonesian the main culture thing I was giving from my heritage is too be as welcoming as possible to every person no matter the gender, origin or anything. Everyone is welcome in our house no mather who you are. (if needed I can provide more context) 

- What did you  do to improve the group communications with respect to cultural differences? 
For our group project we are working together with the OAMK group in Finland. Finnish people tend to be more shy and serious in the beginning, thats why in the beginning of our project I tried to step up as a mediator and set some rules in which everyone could be comfortable and provide the best version of themselves,
I also manage the communication channel which is our discord and act as the main person in between if we need anything. 

## software ethics

### Ethics in my application
*You have made an analysis of the ethical aspects of your application.*

Which ethical aspects play a role in your project? 

The main ethical issue for my project is the handling of security as people can make accounts in which personal information is set. 

Do you foresee ethical conflicts caused by your software? What kind of?  

There should be no immediate ethical conflict by my software as there is no interaction between people.

Can you do something to avoid or minimize these conflicts?

When my frontend is done for the time being I want to test for the user experience and see if they have any comments / would like to change anything.
I want to test a few different groups of people and see how they react. I will test 2 people per group. the groups I want to test are: peer software students in IT, peer Students outside IT, digital illiterates. Below I will desribe per group on the results. I will have a format in which I will use on them all in this order:\

step 1: no information is given, look around.

step 2: Try to find your favorite film.

step 3: I give them a title and they should find on which streamingservice the film / series is available. 

step 4: Add your streamingservices and see if a title is on there.
